"""
The room is decorating, you would like to paint a skyline on the wall.
The skyline consists of rectangular buildings arranged in a line. The building are of the same width, but they may have different heights.
The skyline shape is given as an array A whose elements specify the heights of consecutive buildings. 
Ex:
    Given: [1,3,2,1,2,1,5,3,3,4,2]
Shape:
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] -> 1
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0] -> 2
    [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0] -> 2
    [0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1] -> 3
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> 1
Starting from the bottom, it can paint the skyline in horizontal stripes with 1, 3, 2, 2, 1 strokes per respective stripe
So, it should return 9.
Ex: 
    Given: [1,1,1,1]
It shold return 1
Solution: Given array A, it should return the sum of strokes.
